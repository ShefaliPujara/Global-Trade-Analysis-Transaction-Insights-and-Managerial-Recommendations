    "### **CONCLUSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides valuable insights into global trade dynamics, with 2001 transactions analyzed across key product categories, shipping methods, and countries. The data reveals a slight import dominance, with Machinery and Electronics leading in value. A few large transactions drive the overall trade value, highlighting the importance of focusing on high-margin deals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis shows limited significance for predictors like quantity, necessitating non-parametric methods due to the skewed distribution of transaction values. Key ports and shipping methods were identified as critical to improving logistics efficiency.\n",

    "The managerial insights emphasize strengthening key supplier and customer relationships, optimizing shipping based on weight-to-value ratios, and focusing on high-value products and markets. This data-driven approach enables better trade strategies, enhances profitability, and optimizes supply chain operations."
